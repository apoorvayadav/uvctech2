          <p>It is said that health is the wellspring of life, and that very health is under daily risk from a plethora of viruses and bacteria that we
            have seemingly accepted into our everyday lives and routines: door knobs, door handles, shopping cart handles, and elevator buttons. Hundreds
            if not thousands of people touch these public instruments everyday, unknowingly allowing invisible threats to our health to accumulate.

          <p>In this decade, the public has also realized that traditional chemical solutions to health problems are themselves health risks.
            The FDA banned 19 of the 21 active ingredients in anti-bacterial products currently available. These product include Wet Ones wipes,
            Clorox wipe and Lysol wipes all which cause hormonal damage and birth defects and have no scientific evidence they are more effective
            then plain soap and water.

          <p>Anthony Baldasaro & Apoorva Yadav co-founded UVC Tech to research and develop scalable technologies for everyday use in a variety
            of buildings and equipment. They seek to address the inefficiencies and health risks of traditional antibacterial solutions, whilst
            providing a superior service using advanced technology.

          <p>UVC Tech seeks to revolutionize preventive healthcare by adding UV-C-LED antibacterial technologies to everyday items that we all
            touch. This “add-on” initiative does not require changing existing material or equipment, saving on time and costs; whilst allowing
            for universal acceptance wherever UVC Tech can be used to make our community a healthier, safer place.

        <p>UVC Tech was developed in response to the emerging issues around student health in dormitories and student
          housing as they can become a cesspool for infectious disease in the winter months. Although the technology was initially developed for
          student housing, there are numerous markets that would benefit from the implementation of UV-C-LED Anti-Bacterial technologies.
          If made an industry standard in health care facilities, UV-C-LED Anti-Bacterial technologies will significantly decrease the likelihood
          of invasive infections in all health care facilities while also limiting the use of harmful cleaning chemicals.
          Many UVC Tech Anti-Bacterial technologies use LED’s to emit UV-C light to break the chemical bonds in the surface bacteria
           to eliminate surface transfers. The Liquid Silicone Rubber on the surface of the cover is of medical grade to ensure superior quality. We
           aim to develop technologie of universal sizes or as stretch-to-fit, so that it can truly be used anywhere.
